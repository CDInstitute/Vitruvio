      Vitruvio leverages Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) to generate detailed 3D building meshes from simple sketches.
  - title: Highlights
    items:
      - We introduced learning-based method for single perspective sketch-to-3D applications in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry.
      - We adapted a previous state-of-the-art Conditional Variational Autoencoder (Occupancy Network) to scalable datasets.
      - We showed qualitatively and quantitatively how the building orientation affects the reconstruction.
